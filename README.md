# BLLVM Documentation Archive

This repository contains archived historical documentation from all BLLVM repositories.

## Structure

```
archive/
  bllvm-consensus/    # Historical docs from bllvm-consensus
  bllvm-protocol/     # Historical docs from bllvm-protocol
  bllvm-sdk/          # Historical docs from bllvm-sdk
  bllvm-node/         # Historical docs from bllvm-node
  bllvm-commons/      # Historical docs from bllvm-commons
```

## Purpose

These documents are historical snapshots that document past milestones, implementation phases, and status updates. They are preserved for historical reference but are no longer authoritative.

For current documentation, see the individual repository README files and their active documentation directories.

## Archive Criteria

Documents are archived when they:
- Are historical snapshots (e.g., "*COMPLETE*.md", "*STATUS*.md")
- Document completed phases or milestones
- Contain date-specific information that has become outdated
- Are superseded by current authoritative documentation
