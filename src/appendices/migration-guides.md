# Migration Guides

Migration guides for upgrading between BLLVM versions are documented here.

**Current Status**: No migration guides available yet. The system is in Phase 1 (Infrastructure Building) and has not yet reached production release status requiring migration documentation.

When migration guides are needed, they will cover:
- Configuration changes between versions
- Database schema migrations
- API changes and compatibility
- Breaking changes and upgrade procedures
